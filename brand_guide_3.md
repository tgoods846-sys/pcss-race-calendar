# Sim.Sports Brand Guide

## Fonts
- **Primary/Heading Font:** Montserrat Bold (replacement for Tandelle — original font files unavailable)
- **Secondary/Body Font:** Montserrat Regular/Medium (replacement for Festivo 1)
- **Source:** Google Fonts — freely available, no font files needed
- Note: Original brand fonts are Tandelle and Festivo 1 (used on Wix site). Montserrat is the approved substitute for all generated content.

## Logo Files

Both logos already include the "SIM.SPORTS" brand name in the image. Do NOT add "SIM.SPORTS" as separate text when using either logo — it's already there.

- **sim_sports_logo.jpg** — Stacked version: icon on top, "SIM.SPORTS" text below. White background. Use for light backgrounds. When using, only add the tagline "INDOOR SKI + GOLF" beneath.
- **sim_sports_logo_horizontal_dark.jpg** — Horizontal version: icon left, "SIM.SPORTS" text right. Black background, white text, blue icon. Use for dark backgrounds, social image headers, banners. When using, only add the tagline "INDOOR SKI + GOLF" beneath or beside.

## Slogan
**"Get better in here so you are better out there"**
- "In here" = training at Sim.Sports indoor facility

- Use in video content, social captions, and promotional materials where appropriate

## Usage Notes
- Use Primary Blue (#1190CB) as the main brand color for headers, buttons, accents, and the calendar title
- Use dark (#141414) for body text, secondary elements, and the tagline
- The full logo lockup is: [logo image] → INDOOR SKI + GOLF (the logo image already contains the SIM.SPORTS name — do not repeat it)
- Apply Montserrat Bold for headings/titles and Montserrat Regular for body/tagline text
- Social media images should prominently feature the Primary Blue as the brand color
- For light backgrounds: use sim_sports_logo.jpg
- For dark backgrounds: use sim_sports_logo_horizontal_dark.jpg
