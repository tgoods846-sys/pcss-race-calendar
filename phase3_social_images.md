# Phase 3: Social Media Image Generation

Read `brand_guide.md` and the two logo files in this folder (`sim_sports_logo.jpg` and `sim_sports_logo_horizontal_dark.jpg`).

## Layout Design

All social image templates should use this split layout:

**Top section:** Black/dark background with:
- Sim.Sports logo (use the horizontal dark version)
- "INDOOR SKI + GOLF" tagline — white, large font, bold, directly below the logo
- Race info laid out horizontally: event name, date, location, disciplines

**Bottom section:** Background photo of the race venue

Race info should run across the top, NOT down the left side.

Do NOT include any PCSS badge, button, or branding on social images.

## Formats (in priority order)
1. Instagram Reel / TikTok — 1080×1920 (9:16)
2. Instagram Post — 1080×1080 (1:1)
3. Instagram Story — 1080×1920 (9:16)
4. Facebook — 1200×630

## Image types to generate per event
- **Pre-race announcement** — "This weekend: [Event name] at [Venue]" with date, disciplines
- **Race day** — "Race day! [Event name] at [Venue]"
- **Weekly preview** — consolidated "This week in youth ski racing" graphic
- **Monthly calendar** — visual month view of all upcoming races

## Venue background images

Create a folder `assets/venues/` in the project. I will upload photos for each venue. The image generator should match the race venue name to the filename automatically.

Expected filenames:
- `snowbird.jpg`
- `utah-olympic-park.jpg`
- `sun-valley.jpg`
- `park-city.jpg`
- `snowbasin.jpg`
- `jackson-hole.jpg`
- `palisades-tahoe.jpg`
- `grand-targhee.jpg`
- `sundance.jpg`
- `deer-valley.jpg`
- `bogus-basin.jpg`
- `mammoth.jpg`
- `mission-ridge.jpg`
- `mt-bachelor.jpg`
- `default.jpg` — fallback for any venue without a specific photo

If a venue photo is not yet uploaded, use `default.jpg` as the fallback.
